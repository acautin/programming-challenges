### Coders of the Caribbean

In this game, you are in command of pirate ships and your goal is to  avoid running out of rum. If all the rum dries up on a given ship, your  crew will go mad and you will lose the ship. Barrels of rum are placed  randomly across the map. You must control the movements of your ship in  order to collect the barrels of rum before your opponent does.

### Code4Life

Produce medicines and maximize your score by transporting items across a medical complex.

### Wondev Woman

The game is played on a square grid of a given size. Both players start with two units placed randomly on the grid.
Both players take it in turns to perform one action with one of their units. To score points, players must get a unit to climb up cells and reach a height of 3 levels.

- [Rust implementation](codingame/contests/wondevWoman/main.rs)

### Chuck Norris

A string is an encoded form of digital values and you have to transform those values into a “unary” string such as 0 00 000 0...

- [Java implementation](codingame/puzzles/chuckNorris.java)

### Defibrillators

The goal of this exercise is to make you find the closest point to given geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

- [PHP implementation](codingame/puzzles/defibrillators.php)

### MIME Type

Back to basics with this puzzle where you have to associate file names with their MIME type

- [Dart implementation](codingame/puzzles/mimeTypes.dart)

### There is no Spoon - Episode 1

The goal is to find, when they exist, the horizontal and vertical neighbors nodes from a two dimensional array. The difficulty is in the number of nested loops that this puzzle can make you write. Do not get lost!

- [Python implementation](codingame/puzzles/apuInitPhase.py)

### Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1

The goal of this puzzle is to guess the coordinate of a bomb (line and column of a 2 dimensional array). You will have to make a guess at each step of the puzzle and adjust it from given feedbacks.
